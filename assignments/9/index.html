        <p>One of my favorite places in New York is the Guggenheim Museum, located on Fifth Avenue and 88th Street. The first time I was there was the end of 2016, I did a quick tour of the place, but it was not until the spring break of this year that I had a decent visit there. I love the place for its unique architecture, a spiral rotunda designed by my favorite architect, Frank Wright. In the mean time, there is a nice collection of both abstract and realistic paintings and sculptures.

People should visit Guggenheim, as it is one of many good museums located here, but also it is not too big and overwhelming compared to the Met, or too crowded compared to MoMA. Its unique collection is also definitely worth a visit! <br><br>

Wear comfortable shoes and if you are a student, you can get a student discount if you have a student ID.</p>
